ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING OVERVIEW

Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transformative technologies that are reshaping industries and society. This document provides a comprehensive overview of these technologies, their applications, and their impact on various sectors.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Key Components of AI:
1. Machine Learning: Algorithms that enable computers to learn from data
2. Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language
3. Computer Vision: Interpreting and analyzing visual information
4. Robotics: Physical systems that can interact with the environment
5. Expert Systems: Knowledge-based systems that solve complex problems

Machine Learning Fundamentals
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
4. Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple layers
