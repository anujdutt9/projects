                  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                  <p align='justify'>Hello everyone. This is a new Blog series on <b>Concepts in Machine Learning and Deep Learning</b>. In this I will be covering almost all Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts and coding and explaining the algorithms from scratch. For coding,
                  I will be using <b>Python</b> as the language and the code will be posted on the blog as a <b>Python Jupyter Notebook</b> and will also be available on my <a href="https://github.com/anujdutt9/Machine-Learning">Gihub Repository</a> to download.</p>

                  <p align='justify'>But before diving deep into the concepts, let's first get to know that why we need to learn Machine Learning !!!</p>

                  <h3>What is AI ?</h3>
                  <p align='justify'>We all had a moment sometime back where whe have thought that what is AI ? When we think about AI, what comes to our mind is something like a <b>Terminator</b> or the <b>SkyNet</b> that takes over all the humans killing all of us !!! Well, not that easy.</p>
                  <p align='center'><img src="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/photo.php?sku=902662" alt=""></p>

                  <p align='justify'>There will be another set of people thinking of AI as a Virtual Assistant something like <b>JARVIS</b> from Iron Man.</p>
                  <p align='center'><img src="http://www.ramascreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Iron-Man-e1451896699100.jpg" alt=""></p>
                  <p>You can talk to it, make it do all your work while you enjoy your drink at a beach. Sounds nice :D</p>

                  <h3>But why should I learn AI ?</h3>

                  <p align='justify'>With the continuous development in the field of AI, and lots of Research papers being published almost every 10 days by companies like <a href="https://openai.com/"><b>OpenAI</b></a>, <a href="https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/"><b>Facebook AI Research</b></a>, <a href="https://research.google.com/teams/brain/"><b>Google Brain</b></a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/"><b>DeepMind</b></a> etc. this field is the fastest growing field.</p>
                  <p align='justify'>We now have Generative Networks that can generate a video of a Leader by looking at his/her videos and with any audio which a person wants, it can lead to riots or even war. If the people would have had access to this technology during the World War it might have lead to a much worse war, maybe even leading to the extinction of the human race.</p>
                  <p align='justify'>So, in order to either avoid the <b>AI Apoclypse</b> or to make our own JARVIS, we need to learn these things either way. Now you would ask that when we know that AI development can cause an AI Apoclypse, then why even study it !!! Why all the research in this field ?? The point is that we are not there yet but will be eventually one day. And at that time, if you even know that how these things work even on the top, you might be able to prevent that.</p>
                  <p align='justify'>AI is not thought only in terms of destruction but also as something constructive. Imagine that in future AI is able to read your mind and do the things you want it to do [Neuralink] or maybe you give it a problem like "Solve Poverty" or "Solve Drought" and it is able to solve them all. That way we can all have a better future.</p>
                  <p align='justify'>Machine Learning has been around since the late 50's but at that time neither did we had enough data nor did we have enough compute power as we have today. So, in my view, this time which we are living in is the best time to learn Machine Learning.</p>
                  <p align='justify'>Earlier we used to have a simple CPU that could do some simple calculations whereas now we have powerful CPU's and GPU's all on the same desktop/laptop or even mobile devices. Also, the data has been growing by a large extent and is still growing. These advances
                  lead us to efficiently use the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analysis etc. to make predictions or use the data productively.</p>

                  <p align='justify'>So, where is this AI used ?? Whats the use of studying anything that dosen't has any usecase. Well, we all use AI everyday, almost every moment of our life knowingly or unknowingly. Some of the applications of Artificial Intelligence [ML/DL/CV] in our day to day lives are:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Self Driving Cars using Computer Vision [Tesla, Google, NVIDIA]</li>
                    <li>Virutal Assistants like Google Home, Siri, Alexa, Bixby etc. [Google, Amazon, Apple, Samsung]</li>
                    <li>Market Stock Predictions.</li>
                    <li>Sentiment Analysis.</li>
                    <li>Artifying Images [Prisma]</li>
                    <li>Self-Aware Robots [Nao]</li>
                    <li>Heart Sound Analysis.</li>
                    <li>News generation, Article Summarizer etc.</li>
                    <li>Face Recognition</li>
                    and a lot more. . .
                  </ol>

                  <p align='justify'>So, now you would be thinking, "Good Stuff there, but, how do I actually get started with all this ??". This is my main motivation for writing this Blog series. I think that education should be free and easily accessable to all. Through these Blogs, I will try my best to present these concepts as clearly as possible.</p>

                  <p align='justify'>The code tutorials expect you to be a begenner with no experience at all in Machine Learning or Deep Learning. We will start everything from scratch. Hence, the knowledge of basic Python syntax and some of its in-built libraries will be useful but not required.</p>

                  <p align='justify'>In these tutorials, you can make use of your laptops/desktops or if you think you require more compute power you can spin up a EC2 server on <b>Amazon Web Services</b> or even <b>Google Cloud</b>. Both of these provide with a year long free access to their resources.</p>

                  <p align='justify'><b><i>Great work on completing this tutorial, let's move to <a href="#"><b>Machine Learning #1 : Linear Regression</b></a></i></b></p>
					        <p align='justify'><b><i> For more projects and code, follow me on <a href="https://github.com/anujdutt9">Github</a></i></b></p>
                  <p align='justify'><b>Please feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, corrections if any, below.</b></p>
